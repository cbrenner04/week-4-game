## Star Wars RPG

To start, select your character. You will then select characters one by one to
try and defeat all of them. You win if you defeat all of them, you lose if you
do not.

Each character has a winning condition and a losing condition. Basically, to win
you will need to choose characters to defeat in this order: Obi-wan Kenobi, Luke
Skywalker, Emperor Palpatine, Darth Vader; excluding the character you choose to
be, of course. Losing conditions are (mostly) in the opposite order.
